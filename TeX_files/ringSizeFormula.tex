\section{Ring-Signature formula}
Spectrecoin uses a ring-signature formula developed by Adam Back. He created a formula based on the 
traceable ring signature described in the CryptoNote white-paper\footnote{https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf} using maths based on the paper "1-
out-of-n Signatures from a Variety of Keys"\footnote{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221326919\_1-out-of-n\_Signatures\_from\_a\_Variety\_of\_Keys} by Abe, Ohkubo and Suzuki. He was able to create a linkable ring signature which tends to be \sfrac{1}{2} of the size of the CryptoNote ring signature as the signature is 3+n 
values vs. 2+2n values.  

 

A.Back showed how to add traceability in a way that made it compatible with CryptoNote\footnote{https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=972541.msg10619684}
