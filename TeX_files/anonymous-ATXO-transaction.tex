In the Spectrecoin software we talk about ring sizes and this refers to the
group or set of possible signers. So, in the example below, we have a ring
size of 8 which simply means that amongst the 8 public keys that form part
of the digital signature, 7 are so called ‘mixins’ or chaff or decoys and
only 1 is the public key corresponding to the SPECTRE being spent. When
conducting an anonymous transaction, we use ring signatures to hide spent
output in a set of the same denomination.



Anonymous transactions in Spectrecoin can be said to have levels of
‘transactional entropy’ as there is an interface between the ‘public’
and the ‘anonymous’ coins. Entropy level 0 can be said to be at the
interface between XSPEC >> SPECTRE and between SPECTRE >> XSPEC. Once
SPECTRE has been created from SPECTRE, i.e. an ATXO used as an input to
create a new ATXO we can say that this is entropy level 1 as the freshly
created ATXO has no public UTXO origin. Once these ATXOs are used to
create further ATXOs this would be entropy level 2 and so on. The entropy
increases with every level, IF AND ONLY IF a minimum ring size is used and
the ATXOs have not been part of any ring size 1 transaction.
