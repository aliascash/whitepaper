\section{The Proof-of-Stake (PoSv3) Protocol }
The following section, in its entirety, has been taken directly from, and is based on a blog post by Qtum\footnote{https://qtum.org/en} 
developer ‘Earlz’ from 27/07/2017 called \textit{“The missing explanation of Proof of Stake Version 3”}\footnote{http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version } and is the 
best-known source of information on the PoSv3 protocol. The Spectrecoin PoSv3 implementation adheres 
completely to this protocol description for both blocks and transactions and so the explanation from ‘Earlz’ 
can be used for Spectrecoin.
