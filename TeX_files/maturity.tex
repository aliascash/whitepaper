\section{Maturity}
The maturity calculations have changed such that the minimum maturity for staking and for spending stakes has been increased from 288 to 450 blocks. This is approximately 96 seconds * 450 = 12 hours and hence the 8-hour maturity rule for staking has been removed. Also, note that the updated maturity rule is also considered for all ATXOs used in the ring signature of the staked VIN.
