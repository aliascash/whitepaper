\section{Alias Characteristics}
The Alias software is encompassing and integrating the following:

\begin{table}[h]
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\hline
\textbf{Bitcoin Core} & Core technology of the Alias blockchain. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Proof-of-Stake.v3 (PoSv3)} & Secure open consensus mechanism for ALIAS (public). \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Anonymous-Proof-of-Stake (APoS)} & Secure  private  consensus  mechanism  for  ALIAS (private). \\
\midrule
\textbf{Private transactions} & Using dual-key stealth technology and ring signatures for ALIAS (private). \\
\midrule
\textbf{Tor Hidden Services v3} & to hide your real IP address (\textit{all Alias nodes run as hidden services}). \\
\midrule
\textbf{OBFS4} & To hide the fact that you are using Tor to avoid censorship. \\
\midrule
\textbf{HD Wallets} & Hierarchical Deterministic wallets (BIP-0032 specifications). \\
\hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}
\noindent
Given the specific specifications and design, Alias takes on the characteristics of both a Bitcoin like blockchain and a Monero like blockchain. This combined with a pure PoS strategy makes Alias unique.

\noindent
It is important to understand that the total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount is the sum
of \linebreak ALIAS (public) + ALIAS (private). On the next page we have projected both a minimum and a
maximum inflation rate and total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount of ALIAS (public) + ALIAS (private) over
20 years. The real value of the total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount will depend on the
ratio of ALIAS (public) / ALIAS (private) created by the two different consensus mechanisms
over time.
\newpage

\subsection{Inflation rate over 20 years}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{alias-inflation.png}
	\caption{Min inflation rate after 20 years = 1.88\%, Max inflation
	rate after 20 years = 2.40\% }
\end{figure}
\noindent
The minimum values represent a scenario where 100\% of the blocks
are created by PoSv3.
\linebreak
The maximum values represent a scenario where 100\%
of the blocks are created by APoS.

There are different strategies employed by different cryptocurrencies around
Inflation. Alias differs from Bitcoin and some other
cryptocurrencies in that we have a constant coin generation scheme
but a relative inflation that tends to zero over time. There will
always be an incentive to stake Alias and the system will never
rely on fees alone to provide this incentive. It is beyond the scope
of this paper to have an in-depth discussion about inflation and money
supply and the nature of money and currencies. Alias can be seen
as a ‘medium of exchange’ and the aim is that Alias will be used
to buy/sell goods and other fiat currency in its intended use in future
online cash transfers. Economists discuss and debate this point but some
level of inflation and value creation appears to be beneficial for long
term adoption and will prevent Alias from the potential dangers of
entering a ‘deflationary spiral’ relying on fees alone to sustain the
Alias ecosystem. There doesn’t seem to be a consensus among
scholars of what might be ‘\textit{the best}’ strategy.

\subsection{Total supply (‘outstanding’ amount) over 20 years}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{alias-supply.png}
	\caption{Min supply after 20 years = 34,883,000 ALIAS (public)+ALIAS (private) - Max 
		supply after 20 years = 41,124,500 ALIAS (public)+ALIAS (private)}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The block explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ALIAS/} allows you 
to explore the Alias blockchain and you can see the total supply at any given time.

\subsection{Maturity}
The maturity calculations have changed such that the minimum maturity for
staking and for spending stakes has been increased from 288 to 450 blocks. That means that the new maturity time is approximately $96 seconds * 450 = 12 hours$ and hence the 8-hour maturity rule for staking has been removed. Also, note that the updated maturity rule is also considered for all ATXOs used in the ring signature
of the staked VIN.
\newpage

\subsection{Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work}
Alias uses both PoSv3 and APoS algorithms to keep the network consensus and to secure and confirm transactions. Both PoSv3 and APoS appear to be more resilient against various attacks that could be instigated against a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system like Bitcoin, Litecoin and DASH for example. It is also known that PoW systems are susceptible to so called 51\% attacks where a sufficiently funded and motivated attacker can “\textit{take control}” over the network and generate double spend transactions\footnote{https://www.crypto51.app/}. It is more difficult to attack a PoS system in this way as it would be unfeasible to acquire the majority of Alias in circulation and doing so would undermine the value and remove the incentive for the attack in the first place. There are obviously other attack vectors, such as the recently discovered so called “\textit{Fake Stake}” attack against PoSv3\footnote{https://medium.com/@dsl\_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrenciesb8b05723f806}. This has since been fixed by the Alias developers and Alias is no longer susceptible to such an attack.
\\
\\
\noindent
It is also well known that large PoW driven networks expend huge amounts of energy and appear to lead to some level of centralisation of mining power due to the huge expense involved in mining new blocks. In a recent research paper entitled “\textit{The Bitcoin Mining Network - Trends, Composition, Average Creation Cost, Electricity Consumption \& Sources}” by Christopher Bendiksen \& Samuel Gibbons of CoinShares  Research\footnote{https://coinshares.co.uk/\#mailmunch-pop-792759}, 
it was found that the Bitcoin network expends more energy than the whole country of New Zealand.
\\
\\
\noindent
The report calculated that the global Bitcoin mining industry draws 4.7GW of power every second. Hashing computations for the Proof-of-Work algorithm consumed 4.3GW, up 0.4GW from the last CoinShares report in November 2018. Based on these figures, researchers calculated \textbf{an annual consumption of 41TWh of electricity}. That’s roughly 2.2TWh more than New Zealand – a country of 4.7M people – consumed in 2017, according to the country’s Electricity Authority\footnote{https://www.ea.govt.nz/}.
\\
\\
\noindent
In comparison, Alias will run on a standard Raspberry Pi and in addition to all the privacy features, Alias is also truly eco-friendly, sustainable and ‘\textit{green technology}’. The estimated loose upper bound, \textbf{annual 
consumption for a Raspberry Pi running Alias is 16.6kWh}.

\vspace{3mm} %5mm vertical space

Bitcoin network:\\
$41 TWh = 41*1012 Wh = 41,000,000,000,000 Wh$

\vspace{3mm} %5mm vertical space

Alias node:\\
$16.6 KWh = 16.6 * 103 Wh = 16,600 Wh * 1000 (nodes) = 16,600,000 Wh$

\vspace{3mm} %5mm vertical space

\noindent
That means that the whole \textit{Bitcoin network consumes almost \textbf{2.5 million times
more energy} than what an imaginary Alias network would consume}, assuming
1000 Alias Raspberry Pi nodes.
\newpage
\noindent
In summary, the PoSv3 / APoS protocols are both potentially more secure,
immensely more energy efficient and provide for better decentralisation.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this further and there are
various discussions around the internet if you are interested in the PoW vs.
PoS debate.

In the next sections we will explore the different aspects of Alias in
more detail. We start on the next page with a detailed introduction to the
Alias privacy features before we go on to discuss Proof-of-Stake v3
(PoSv3) in detail. We move on to explain the privacy features and the new
Anonymous-Proof-of-Stake (APoS) protocol.
