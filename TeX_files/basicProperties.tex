\chapter{Spectrecoin Basic Properties}
The Spectrecoin software is encompassing and integrating the following: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bitcoin Core (core technology of the Spectrecoin block-chain) 
	\item Proof-of-Stake.v3 (PoSv3) (secure ‘open’ consensus mechanism for XSPEC public coins)
	\item Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake (PoAS) (secure private consensus mechanism for SPECTRE private coins)
	\item Private transactions (using dual-key stealth technology and ring signatures for SPECTRE) 
	\item TOR to hide your real IP address (all Spectrecoin nodes run as hidden services) 
	\item OBFS4 to hide the fact that you are using TOR to avoid censorship	
\end{itemize}
