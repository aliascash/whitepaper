\section{Spectrecoin Basic Properties}
The Spectrecoin software is encompassing and integrating the following:

\begin{description}
	\item[Bitcoin Core] (core technology of the Spectrecoin block-chain)
	\item[Proof-of-Stake.v3 (PoSv3)] (secure ‘open’ consensus mechanism for XSPEC public coins)
	\item[Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake (PoAS)] (secure private consensus mechanism for SPECTRE private coins)
	\item[Private transactions] (using dual-key stealth technology and ring signatures for SPECTRE)
	\item[TOR] to hide your real IP address (all Spectrecoin nodes run as hidden services)
	\item[OBFS4] to hide the fact that you are using TOR to avoid censorship
\end{description}

It is important to understand that the total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount is the sum
of XSPEC + SPECTRE. On the next page we have projected both a minimum and a
maximum inflation rate and total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount of XSPEC + SPECTRE over
20 years. The real value of the total ‘\textit{outstanding}’ amount will depend on the
ratio of XSPEC / SPECTRE created by the two different consensus mechanisms
over time. The minimum values represent a scenario where 100\% of the blocks
are created by PoSv3 and the maximum values represent a scenario where 100\%
of the blocks are created by PoAS.

There are different strategies employed by different cryptocurrencies around 
Inflation\footnote{\textit{Spectrecoin differs from Bitcoin and some other 
cryptocurrencies in that we have a constant coin generation scheme 
but a relative inflation that tends to zero over time. There will 
always be an incentive to stake Spectrecoin and the system will never 
rely on fees alone to provide this incentive. It is beyond the scope 
of this paper to have an in-depth discussion about inflation and money 
supply and the nature of money and currencies. Spectrecoin can be seen 
as a ‘medium of exchange’ and the aim is that Spectrecoin will be used 
to buy/sell goods and other fiat currency in its intended use in future 
online cash transfers. Economists discuss and debate this point but some 
level of inflation and value creation appears to be beneficial for long 
term adoption and will prevent Spectrecoin from the potential dangers of 
entering a ‘deflationary spiral’ relaying on fees alone to sustain the 
Spectrecoin ecosystem.}}. There doesn’t seem to be a consensus amongst 
scholars of what might be ‘\textit{the best}’ strategy.



\subsection{Total supply (‘outstanding’ amount) over 20 years}


\begin{figure}[ht]

		supply after 20 years = 41,124,500 XSPEC+SPECTRE}

The block explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/} allows you 
to explore the Spectrecoin blockchain.



\subsection{Maturity}
The maturity calculations have changed such that the minimum maturity for
staking and for spending stakes has been increased from 288 to 450 blocks.
This is approximately 96 seconds * 450 = 12 hours and hence the 8-hour
maturity rule for staking has been removed. Also, note that the updated
maturity rule is also considered for all ATXOs used in the ring signature
of the staked VIN.



\subsection{Reward and Fee Handling}
The stake reward for a PoAS block is 3 SPECTRE and 2 XSPEC for a PoSv3 block.
The fees are the same for both XSPEC and SPECTRE transactions.



\subsection{Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work}
Spectrecoin uses both PoSv3 and PoAS algorithms to keep the network consensus
and to secure and confirm transactions. Both PoSv3 and PoAS appear to be more
resilient against various attacks that could be instigated against a
Proof-of-Work (PoW) system like Bitcoin, Litecoin and DASH for example.
It is also known that PoW systems are susceptible to so called 51\% attacks
where a sufficiently funded and motivated attacker can “\textit{take control}” over
the network and generate double spend transactions\footnote{https://www.crypto51.app/}. 
It is more difficult to attack a PoS system in this way as it would be infeasible 
to acquire the majority of Spectrecoin in circulation and doing so would undermine 
the value and remove the incentive for the attack in the first place. There are 
obviously other attack vectors, such as the recently discovered so called 
“\textit{Fake Stake}” attack against 
PoSv3\footnote{https://medium.com/@dsl\_uiuc/fake-stake-attacks-on-chain-based-proof-of-stake-cryptocurrenciesb8b05723f806}. 
This has since been fixed by the Spectrecoin developers and Spectrecoin is no 
longer susceptible to such an attack.



It is also well known that large PoW driven networks expend huge amounts of
energy and appears to lead to some level of centralisation of mining power
due to the huge expense involved in mining new blocks. In a recent research
paper entitled “\textit{The Bitcoin Mining Network - Trends, Composition, Average
Creation Cost, Electricity Consumption \& Sources}” by Christopher Bendiksen
\& Samuel Gibbons of CoinShares 
Research\footnote{https://coinshares.co.uk/\#mailmunch-pop-792759}, 
it was found that the Bitcoin network expends more energy than the whole 
country of New Zealand.



The report calculated that the global Bitcoin mining industry draws 4.7GW of
power every second. Hashing computations for the Proof-of-Work algorithm
consumed 4.3GW, up 0.4GW from the last CoinShares report in November 2018.
Based on these figures, researchers calculated \textbf{an annual consumption of
41TWh of electricity}. That’s roughly 2.2TWh more than New Zealand – a country
of 4.7M people – consumed in 2017, according to the country’s Electricity
Authority\footnote{https://www.ea.govt.nz/}.



In comparison, Spectrecoin will run on a standard Raspberry Pi and in addition
to all the privacy features, Spectrecoin is also truly eco-friendly, sustainable
and ‘\textit{green technology}’. The estimated loose upper bound, \textbf{annual 
consumption for a Raspberry Pi running Spectrecoin is 16.6kWh}.

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Bitcoin network:\\
$41 TWh = 41*1012 Wh = 41,000,000,000,000 Wh$

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

Spectrecoin node:\\
$16.6 KWh = 16.6 * 103 Wh = 16,600 Wh * 1000 (nodes) = 16,600,000 Wh$

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

That means that the whole \textit{Bitcoin network consumes almost 2.5 million times
more energy than what an imaginary Spectrecoin network would consume}, assuming
1000 Spectrecoin Raspberry Pi nodes.




In summary, the PoSv3 / PoAS protocols are both potentially more secure,
immensely more energy efficient and provides for better decentralisation.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this further and there are
various discussions around the internet if you are interested in the PoW vs.
PoS debate.



In the next sections we will explore the different aspects of Spectrecoin in
more detail. We start on the next page with a detailed introduction to the
Spectrecoin privacy features before we go on to discuss Proof-of-Stake v3
(PoSv3) in detail. We move on to explain the privacy features and the new
Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake (PoAS) protocol.
