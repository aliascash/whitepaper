\chapter{Spectrecoin Basic Properties}
The Spectrecoin software is encompassing and integrating the following: 
- Bitcoin Core (core technology of the Spectrecoin block-chain) 
- Proof-of-Stake.v3 (PoSv3) (secure ‘open’ consensus mechanism for XSPEC public coins) 
- Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake (PoAS) (secure private consensus mechanism for SPECTRE private coins) 
- Private transactions (using dual-key stealth technology and ring signatures for SPECTRE) 
- TOR to hide your real IP address (all Spectrecoin nodes run as hidden services) 
- OBFS4 to hide the fact that you are using TOR to avoid censorship
