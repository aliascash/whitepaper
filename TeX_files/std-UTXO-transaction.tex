On the blockchain there is a direct correlation between the inputs and the outputs, and all the transactions 
can be traced back to the genesis transactions. This is still the case even if a mixing strategy is used, such 
as in DASH. There are increasingly sophisticated methods to analyse blockchain data and this is a growth 
industry. You should consider any standard UTXO transactions to be non-anonymous and public, whether 
with Spectrecoin or Bitcoin.
