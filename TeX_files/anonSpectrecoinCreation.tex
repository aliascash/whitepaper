\section{Anonymous Spectrecoin Conversion}
Dual-key Stealth technology is used in the process to create anonymous SPECTRE by consuming the equivalent value of XSPEC. The creation of SPECTRE involves the creation of an ATXO with a bundled one-time key-pair that will allow that ATXO to be ‘spent’ by providing a valid ring signature using your remaining public key corresponding to the ATXO you previously created and the corresponding ‘keyimage’21. The fact that an ATXO has been ‘spent’ is only known to the sender and an observer cannot determine if the ATXO has been ‘spent’.
