\section{Introduction}
Spectrecoin strives to provide real-world confidential and private
transactions that will withstand any kind of blockchain analysis by
the most hostile and determined attacker. We will achieve this through
constantly working to test and audit the source code and seek to improve
the privacy of our transactions and develop new technology. With the
recent introduction of a totally private staking protocol,
‘Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake’, you can now also keep your money private and
earn a healthy interest by running the Spectrecoin software. In this
context it is important to understand and appreciate that any cryptocurrency
aiming for private transactions will be up against increasingly sophisticated
ways to analyse the blockchain and increasingly sophisticated analytical tools.
It is in fact an arms race and we must therefore not sit back and claim that
our privacy is forever unbreakable, but we must conduct an honest and
fearless audit of the algorithms and methods behind the private transactions
and discover our own weaknesses and vulnerabilities. We then need to work to
improve our code to stay at the front of the arms race. We will then become
a trusted and functional cryptocurrency with real-world privacy, one of the
few out there, beyond just the hype. It is therefore also important that our
users understand what is real and what is not when it comes to online privacy.
