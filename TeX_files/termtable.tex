\textbf{Keyimage} & A unique value associated with a specific ATXO
calculated using a private key. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Spent (UTXO)} & A UTXO is spent when it has been ‘consumed’ as an
input in a new transaction. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{Spent (ATXO)} & An ATXO is spent when the related ‘keyimage’ has

\midrule
\textbf{Hash Function} & A mathematical one-way function that generates 
fixed size data from an arbitrary input. \\

\midrule
\textbf{VIN} & The ‘collection’ of input data for a transaction, including 
the UTXOs/ATXOs to be consumed. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{VOUT} & The ‘collection’ of output data for a transaction, including 
the new UTXOs/ATXOs generated. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{PoS} & Proof-of-Stake. A consensus mechanism introduced with Peercoin. \\

We will use some screenshots from the Alias block
explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ALIAS/} to show examples of
transactions and to explain some of the features. The block explorer
is not custom made for the Alias Blockchain and will always show ‘\textit{ALIAS}’
as the designation behind a value. When this is preceded by the word
‘\textit{Anonymous}’ it designates a ALIAS (private) value.
