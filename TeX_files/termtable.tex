\textbf{VIN} & The ‘collection’ of input data for a transaction, including 
the UTXOs/ATXOs to be consumed. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{VOUT} & The ‘collection’ of output data for a transaction, including 
the new UTXOs/ATXOs generated. \\ 
\midrule
\textbf{POS} & Proof-of-Stake. A consensus mechanism introduced with Peercoin. \\

\textbf{POSV3} & Proof-of-Stake v3. Consensus mechanism developed by the 
Blackcoin developers. \\

We will use some screenshots from the Spectrecoin block
explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/} to show examples of
transactions and to explain some of the features. The block explorer
is not custom made for Spectrecoin and will always show ‘\textit{XSPEC}’
as the designation behind a value. When this is preceded by the word
‘\textit{Anonymous}’ it designates a SPECTRE value.
