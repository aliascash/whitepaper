\chapter{The Spectrecoin Foundation}
The Spectrecoin Foundation CIC is a UK registered ‘\textit{Community Interest Company}‘. 
This means that we are strictly a \textbf{not-for-profit} endeavour focused 
on developing and promoting our software, \textbf{Spectrecoin}. The remit 
for the foundation also covers an effort to encourage wider adoption and 
use of Spectrecoin.



We are subject to UK rules, regulation and company law and the foundation 
is also responsible for managing the ‘\textbf{\textit{Spectrecoin Development Fund}}‘ 
to further the aims of the foundation. We are therefore accountable to 
the UK authorities with regards to our not-for-profit status and we will 
file financial reports just like any other UK company that will be publicly 
available. In this way users of Spectrecoin can be confident that any funds 
coming into the foundation are used only for product development and 
promotion. As the UK has strict laws and regulation around how companies 
operate, we feel that we achieve maximum transparency as opposed to a company 
registered in some offshore territory or other tax haven with relaxed but 
opaque corporate regulation and taxation. 



\section{Benefits for Users and Investors}
(1) The ‘Spectrecoin Development Fund‘ is managed within a regulated corporate structure specifically set up to be a not-for-profit organisation where the stated objective is to benefit the community. This cannot be changed unless the corporation as such is dissolved. 

(2) The current members of the foundation are dedicated to the long-term development of Spectrecoin. The members have a personal stake in the project and a responsibility under UK law to manage the funds and further the stated aim of the foundation. 

(3) There are currently 4 members (see below), but members can join and members can leave. The foundation in effect ‘owns‘ the Spectrecoin official GitHub repo and the GitHub organisation and is therefore recognised as the only entity that will issue official Spectrecoin software. The foundation will also own all the right to the web domains and any other Spectrecoin intellectual property. That means that even if the original members would leave the foundation, other members could join and have 100\% control over Spectrecoin resources in the future. The current members would relinquish any control over any Spectrecoin asset upon leaving the foundation. 

(4) Should the development fund allow, the foundation members could be paid up industry standard salaries that would be subject to scrutiny under UK law. In this way, there are strict limits to the level of renumeration members could receive. 

(5) The entirety of the funds will be used for development of the software, that could include hiring people or using contractors. Should the development fund be of substantial value beyond development costs and salaries, any surplus would be used for research grants or funding of research into privacy technology or to further the adoption of Spectrecoin. 

(6) The fact that the foundation and a corporate structure exists does not in any way detract from the objective of developing privacy focused blockchain technology and does not in any way impose any restrictions on our research and development by the UK government. (also see disclaimer).
