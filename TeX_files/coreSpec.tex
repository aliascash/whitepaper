It is important to understand that the total ‘outstanding’ amount is the sum of XSPEC + SPECTRE. On the next page we have projected both a minimum and a maximum inflation rate and total ‘outstanding’ amount of XSPEC + SPECTRE over 20 years. The real value of the total ‘outstanding’ amount will depend on the ratio of XSPEC / SPECTRE created by the two different consensus mechanisms over time. The minimum values represent a scenario where 100\% of the blocks are created by PoSv3 and the maximum values represent a scenario where 100\% of the blocks are created by PoAS.
