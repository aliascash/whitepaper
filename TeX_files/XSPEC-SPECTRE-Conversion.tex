\section{XSPEC/SPECTRE Conversion}
Each user can convert (non-private) XSPEC coins into (private) coins, SPECTRE.
Users can then send SPECTRE to other users and split or merge the SPECTRE they
own in any way that preserves the total value. Once SPECTRE has been created
and matured the user will also be able to stake in private through the PoAS
protocol. Users can also convert SPECTRE back into XSPEC, though in principle
this is not necessary: all transactions can be made in terms of SPECTRE.



Your wallet will show your XSPEC balance, your SPECTRE balance and on top the
total balance.



The core privacy technology used in Spectrecoin is: Recipient privacy: Stealth
addresses are used to protect the recipient’s privacy. (SPECTRE only) Sender
privacy: Ring Signatures are used to protect the sender’s privacy. (SPECTRE
only) IP address privacy: All Spectrecoin nodes run as TOR hidden services to
protect users IP address. Un-traceability: for each incoming transaction all
possible senders are equiprobable. (SPECTRE only) Un-linkability: for two
outgoing transactions it is impossible to prove the same receiver. (SPECTRE
only)



Now let’s have a look at the different features in some more detail in the
following sections. We aim to briefly explain the background and nature of
stealth addresses and ring-signatures and how this is used in Spectrecoin.
