\textbf{Alias} would not have been possible without the foundations
laid by what came before and in particular the
\textit{Bitcoin}\footnote{https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf},
\textit{Blackcoin}\footnote{https://blackcoin.org/blackcoin-pos-protocol-v2-whitepaper.pdf}
and
\textit{ShadowCash}\footnote{https://www.cryptoground.com/shadowcash-white-paper}
developers and the work by the authors of the
\textit{CryptoNote}\footnote{https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf}
and \textit{Zerocoin}\footnote{http://zerocoin.org/} protocol that
provided inspiration for
some of the technologies developed for use in Alias. Although the
Alias lineage can be traced back through previous projects, open
source software provides inspiration for innovation and progress.
Alias has taken a particular direction to improve, enhance,
innovate and further develop the unique privacy technology inherent
in its code base. The Alias developers have also written copious
amounts of original code and developed innovative technology not seen
in any other comparable cryptocurrency.
