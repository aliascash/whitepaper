We will use some screenshots from the Spectrecoin block
explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/} to show examples of
transactions and to explain some of the features. The block explorer
is not custom made for Spectrecoin and will always show ‘\textit{XSPEC}’
as the designation behind a value. When this is preceded by the word
‘\textit{Anonymous}’ it designates a SPECTRE value.
