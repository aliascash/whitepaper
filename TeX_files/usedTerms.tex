\chapter{Commonly Used Terms}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Blockchain}: A shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions in blocks. 
	\item \textbf{Block}: A defined data structure that contains a record of transaction data and other values. 
	\item \textbf{XSPEC}: The symbol (ticker) for Spectrecoin and also the name of the public coins on the blockchain. 
	\item \textbf{SPECTRE}: The name used for the private coins on the Spectrecoin blockchain. 
	\item \textbf{UTXO}: Unspent Transaction Output that can be spent as an input in a new transaction. 
	\item \textbf{ATXO}: UTXO that can be spent as in input in a private transaction using a ring signature. 
	\item \textbf{Keyimage}: A unique value associated with a specific ATXO calculated using a private key. 
	\item \textbf{Spent (UTXO)}: A UTXO is spent when it has been ‘consumed’ as an input in a new transaction. 
	\item \textbf{Spent (ATXO)}: An ATXO is spent when the related ‘keyimage’ has been included in a valid ring signature. 
	\item \textbf{Hash function}: A mathematical one-way function that generates fixed size data from an arbitrary input. 
	\item \textbf{Hash value}: A numeric \textbf{value} of a fixed length that uniquely identifies the data input in a hash function. 
	\item \textbf{Block hash}: The hash of a block's header. 
	\item \textbf{Kernel Hash}: A hash value used in Proof-of-Stake. 
	\item \textbf{Mixin}: A chaff or dummy ATXO not being spent in a current transaction, used in a ring signature. 
	\item \textbf{TOR}: The Onion Router. A layered network that attempts to hide your IP address. 
	\item \textbf{VIN}: The ‘collection’ of input data for a transaction, including the UTXOs/ATXOs to be consumed. 
	\item \textbf{VOUT}: The ‘collection’ of output data for a transaction, including the new UTXOs/ATXOs generated. 
	\item \textbf{PoS}: Proof-of-Stake. A consensus mechanism introduced with Peercoin 
	\item \textbf{PoSv3}: Proof-of-Stake v3. Consensus mechanism developed by the Blackcoin developers. 
	\item \textbf{PoAS}: Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake. Privacy consensus mechanism introduced by the Spectrecoin developers. 
\end{itemize}

 

We will use some screenshots from the Spectrecoin block explorer\footnote{https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/} to show examples of transactions and to explain some of the features. The block explorer is not custom made for Spectrecoin and will always show ‘\textit{XSPEC}’ as the designation behind a value. When this is preceded by the word ‘\textit{Anonymous}’ it designates a SPECTRE value.
