\section{Minimum Ring Size}

A minimum ring size of 10 is being enforced as part of the consensus since Spectrecoin v3.x. 

 

Any ATXO used in a ring size 1 transaction will be marked as ‘compromised’ and will not be selected as a 
‘mixin’ in any future ring signature transaction. 

 

We have seen how dual-key stealth address techniques are used to create ATXOs on the Spectrecoin 
blockchain with bundled one-time key pair that can only be ‘spent’ by providing a valid ring signature. 
In this way Spectrecoin protects the privacy of both the sender and the receiver.
