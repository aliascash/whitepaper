Calculate the blockTime =
'current time' - 'itself' (mod 16)
(modulus is like dividing by 16, but taking the remainder)

Calculate the posDifficulty =
the 'network difficulty' * 'number of coins held in a UTXO'

Cycle through for each UTXO in the wallet.

With each UTXO calculate a SHA256 hash using:
'previous block's stake modifier'
'some data from the the UTXO' + 'the blockTime'

Compare this hash to the posDifficulty.

If hash is less than posDifficulty, then 'kernel hash' is valid

You can then create a new block.

After going through all UTXOs, if no valid 'kernel hash'

Then wait 16 seconds and do it all over again.
